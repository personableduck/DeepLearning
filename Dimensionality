Dimensionality
From what we've learned so far, how can we calculate the number of neurons of each layer in our CNN?

Given:

our input layer has a width of W and a height of H
our convolutional layer has a filter size F
we have a stride of S
a padding of P
and the number of filters K,
the following formula gives us the width of the next layer: W_out = (Wâˆ’F+2P)/S+1.

The output height would be H_out = (H-F+2P)/S + 1.

And the output depth would be equal to the number of filters D_out = K.

The output volume would be W_out * H_out * D_out.

Knowing the dimensionality of each additional layer helps us understand how large our model is and how our decisions around filter size and stride affect the size of our network.
